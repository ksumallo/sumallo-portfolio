## Key Takeaways
1. You begin to realize and appreciate the life JavaScript brings to websites when you try to create one yourself and you end up feeling frustrated why yours isn't as satisfactory as the websites you see on a daily basis. 

2. Developing with only HTML and CSS  really challenging but fun. There is a profound feeling that comes down when you see your website seamlessly adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions. Although some UI and UX elements could've been implemented with the help of JS, putting constraints one's creativity could sometimes result to something clever, satisfying, and visually pleasing.
